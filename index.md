## Welcome to Adev's PD2 Filter

You can use the filter from GitHub (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arrested-Dev/PD2-Lootfilter/main/default.filter) directly saved into your home project diablo 2 folder, as default.filter or as loot.filter.

Whenever the PD2 launcher is updated with an auto-download link for loot filters, it should be possible to simply insert the link above there. 

### What is PD2?!

Project Diablo 2 is a new mod for Diablo 2 from the brains of SenpaiSomething, battle the hostile denizens of the outer plains and venture to battlegrounds new in an altogether more challenging arena, with modified items and settings.

```markdown
This Loot filter will:

Remove inferior items from the ground at all levels
Slowly filter out normal, exceptional and eventually even elite base items, until only the most relevant remain
Ignore more magic and rare items at high levels
Colour your identified charms so you can see at a glance which ones are good
Increase visibility of custom items and high level uniques/sets (and set a notification on drop)
Colourize runes, PD2 items
```

For more details on PD2, see https://www.ProjectDiablo2.com

### "Will you add this to your filter/I found a bug in your filter??"

Feel free to get in touch if you can think of anything you think should be changed or is out of place in the filter. Suggestions will always be considered, if not always acted upon.
